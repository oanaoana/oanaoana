### üëã Hi, I'm Oana

I'm a computational scientist with a PhD in applied mathematics and 11+ years of experience in numerical analysis, scientific computing, and high-performance algorithms. I care deeply about the robustness, speed, and accuracy of the simulations we build.

I‚Äôve worked on large-scale scientific software like Nek5000, PETSc and MOOSE, tackled complex physics applications, and recently started [PeraCompute Technologies](https://peracompute.org) to focus on AI powered tools for cutting-edge R&D.
